				<h2>Engineering</h2>
				<p>This is my favorite part where I will share some of my open-source projects in fields including embedded development, integrated circuit design, and more.</p>
				<p>Currently, the first project that I am interested in is building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accelerator using FPGA. A FPGA-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accelerator is a hardware device specifically designed to accelerate the inference of CNN models. It leverages the parallel computing and reconfigurable nature of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to provide high performance and low power consumption acceleration. Typically, this accelerator exists as a hardware acceleration module that executes key operations such as convolution, pooling, and activation functions in the CNN. It efficiently handles large-scale matrix multiplication operations and improves computational efficiency through parallel computing and data reuse techniques. Furthermore, FPGA-based accelerators optimize data flow and resource utilization through customized hardware architectures and memory hierarchies. FPGA-based CNN accelerators are characterized by their high flexibility and strong customization, allowing for optimization and adaptation to different CNN models and application requirements. They find wide applications in edge computing, embedded systems, and cloud servers, providing efficient neural network computing capabilities.</p>
				<p>Another project that I am interested in is designing an 8-bit CPU based on the RISC-V architecture. An 8-bit RISC-V CPU is a central processing unit based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) that operates on 8-bit data. The RISC-V ISA is an open-source instruction set architecture that provides a standardized and extensible framework for designing CPUs. The 8-bit version of the RISC-V CPU is designed to handle data in 8-bit format, which allows for compact and low-power implementations. The 8-bit RISC-V CPU follows the principles of the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture, which emphasizes simplicity and efficiency in instruction execution. It typically includes a small and fixed set of instructions, a simple and uniform instruction format, and a pipeline architecture for efficient instruction processing. While the 8-bit RISC-V CPU may have limited computing power compared to higher bit variants, it is suitable for low-complexity and power-constrained applications. It can be used in various embedded systems, IoT devices, and other resource-limited environments where small form factor and low power consumption are critical considerations. The 8-bit RISC-V CPU can be customized and optimized for specific applications, enabling efficient execution of tasks that require 8-bit data processing, such as sensor data acquisition, signal processing, and lightweight control systems.</p>

				<h2>Mathematics</h2>
				<p>In the first three sections, we will make use of a substantial amount of mathematical knowledge. Without sufficient mathematical support, it is difficult for us to grasp the essence of science, technology, and engineering. Due to limitations in resources, I will first introduce what I personally consider to be the most important five courses: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Mathematical Statistics, Complex Variables and Integral Transforms, and Discrete Mathematics.</p>
				<p>Calculus is a fundamental branch of mathematics that investigates change and motion. It provides a powerful toolset for analyzing and describing the behavior of functions and their rates of change. Calculus consists of two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus focuses on the concept of derivatives, which measure the instantaneous rate of change of a function. Integral calculus, on the other hand, deals with integrals, which represent the accumulation of quantities over intervals. Calculus plays a crucial role in various scientific disciplines, such as physics, engineering, economics, and computer science, enabling us to solve problems involving optimization, differential equations, and modeling complex systems.</p>
				<p>Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies vectors, vector spaces, and linear transformations. It provides a framework for solving systems of linear equations and understanding geometric properties of objects in higher dimensions. Linear algebra involves operations such as addition, scalar multiplication, and matrix multiplication. Key concepts include vectors, which are quantities with magnitude and direction, and matrices, which are rectangular arrays of numbers. Linear transformations describe how objects change under linear operations. Applications of linear algebra can be found in numerous fields, including physics, computer science, data analysis, and engineering. It provides essential tools for solving problems involving optimization, data fitting, and understanding relationships between variables.</p>
				<p>Probability theory and mathematical statistics are two interrelated branches of mathematics that deal with the analysis and interpretation of data, as well as the quantification of uncertainty and randomness. Probability theory focuses on the study of random events and their mathematical properties. It provides a framework for making predictions and calculating the likelihood of different outcomes. Mathematical statistics, on the other hand, deals with the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, aiming to draw meaningful conclusions or make inferences about the population from which the data is collected. These fields play a fundamental role in various disciplines, such as finance, biology, psychology, and epidemiology, providing tools for decision-making, risk assessment, and experimental design.</p>
				<p>Complex analysis and integral transforms are two branches of mathematics that deal with functions defined on complex numbers and the transformation of functions using integral operations. Complex analysis studies functions of complex variables, which are functions that take complex numbers as inputs and outputs. It explores the properties of complex functions, such as holomorphicity and differentiability, and investigates topics like contour integration, residue theory, and conformal mapping. Integral transforms, on the other hand, are mathematical operations that convert functions from one domain to another using integral operators. Examples include the Laplace transform, Fourier transform, and Z-transform. These techniques are widely used in engineering, physics, signal processing, and other fields to solve differential equations, analyze signals, and manipulate functions in a convenient way.</p>
				<p>Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with mathematical structures and objects that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. It focuses on studying mathematical concepts and techniques that are applicable to discrete structures, such as integers, graphs, sets, and logic. Discrete mathematics encompasses various topics, including combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, logic, and algorithms. It plays a crucial role in computer science, cryptography, operations research, and other disciplines that rely on discrete structures and discrete decision-making processes. Discrete mathematics provides the foundation for understanding and solving problems in areas like data analysis, optimization, and computational complexity, making it an essential tool for modern technology and scientific research.</p>
